Like a chorus. <br/>Like three blocks of blackstone with the same lousy inscription. <br/><em>Grandfather, father, son.</em> <br/>Who will be the next interred? <br/><p/>Someone lit a match. <br/>Paper bills— SUVs— luxury mansions <br/>went up in flames. Delivered to the afterlife <br/>where no more years had difficulties. <br/><p/>Downwind, we coughed with red eyes <br/>&amp; watched the sky char. <br/><p/>Apart from my dreams, I've almost forgotten <br/>what he looked like— when he breathed his last, his hand <br/>slipped slowly out of time— all wilt &amp; thin to the bones. <br/> 
We weren't allowed to look at his face. <br/>Thus were the mysteries of a life <br/>I never had a chance to suffer. And on the seventh day <br/>we all cried, our knees against the cold stone steps, forehead <br/>clung to the ground. But I never did fall <br/>on my knees. I had to remember him my way: <br/>No, not as a hero, but <br/>one day I saw his apparition <br/>on the evergreen fields, a face bronze <br/>under the sun &amp; covered in dirt, plowing, <br/>sowing, toiling the land— <br/></mainmatter> </tree><tree expanded="true" show-heading="true" show-metadata="false" toc="true" root="false"><frontmatter><trail><crumb>2</crumb></trail> <anchor>139</anchor>   <addr>poem-0004</addr>  <route>poem-0004.xml</route> <date><year>2023</year> <month>10</month> <day>3</day></date> <authors><author><link href="atticusw.xml" type="local">atticusw</link></author> </authors> <title>Untitled Curse/Ode</title> </frontmatter> <mainmatter><p/>Earth has undergone <br/>ten revolutions, and I still<br/>rip off page after page<br/>from my notebook, till I've drained <br/>all its soul, futile ink<br/>seeped into imperfections, its powers<br/>dissolved.
